# Project Status: Doodle Jump Backup

## Last Work Point:
Applied changes to `index_standalone.html` to increase player jump height, adjust initial player position, and ensure the first platform is reachable. Also increased canvas size.

## Open Issues / Known Problems:
1.  **Platform Dynamics:** The platforms appear to "fly upwards" or the game's vertical scrolling/dynamism feels off.
2.  **Game Speed:** The game feels too fast. This might be related to the platform dynamics or other game loop parameters.

## Next Steps (Suggested):
1.  Investigate and adjust game speed and vertical scrolling logic to restore proper platform dynamics.
2.  Review gravity and jump force in relation to the new canvas size and player movement.
