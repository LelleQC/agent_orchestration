The initial complexity assessment of 'Medium' was accurate. The core game logic was simple, but the graphical and audio enhancements added a significant amount of work.

When a project requires external assets like images or sounds, it is more reliable to generate them programmatically or to have them available locally. Relying on downloading assets from the web can lead to failures due to hotlink protection or other issues.
