# Project Report: Doodle Jump Ultimate

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to create a visually enhanced version of the classic Doodle Jump game. The project was successful, and all the planned features were implemented.

## Successes

*   The new character and platform graphics were successfully implemented.
*   The parallax scrolling background adds a nice depth to the game.
*   The particle and sound effects enhance the user experience.
*   The start and game-over screens provide a clear game flow.

## Challenges

*   Downloading external assets like sound files proved to be unreliable. This was solved by using the Web Audio API to generate sounds programmatically.
