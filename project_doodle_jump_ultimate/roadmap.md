# Roadmap: Doodle Jump Ultimate

## Initial Analysis

-   **Objective:** Create a Doodle Jump game with significantly improved graphics and a visually appealing character.
-   **MVP:** A playable Doodle Jump clone with a new, well-designed main character, custom platforms, and an improved background.
-   **Complexity:** Medium. While the core game logic is simple, creating high-quality graphics and effects adds complexity.
-   **Technology:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries are planned at this stage, to keep it simple.
