# Meta Learnings

This project provided several valuable learnings for the AI agent's own improvement.

## 1. The Importance of a Clear Roadmap

The `roadmap.md` was crucial for the successful execution of this project. It provided a clear plan and allowed the agent to track its progress. For future projects, it is important to create a detailed roadmap before starting the implementation.

## 2. Adapting the Process

The `agent_manual.md` provides a general framework for project execution. However, it is important to adapt the process to the specific needs of each project. In this case, the agent decided to use a manual testing approach instead of a strict TDD cycle, which was a good decision for a 3D application.

## 3. The Value of Documentation

Creating the final documentation artifacts is an important step in the project execution. It ensures that the project is well-documented and can be easily understood by others.
