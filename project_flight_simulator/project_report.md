# Project Report

## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to create a simple, browser-based 3D flight simulator as a demonstration of an autonomous AI agent's capabilities.

## Execution

The project was executed by following the `agent_manual.md`. The agent started by analyzing the request and creating a `roadmap.md` file. The roadmap defined the MVP and the high-level features to be implemented.

The agent then implemented the features in a step-by-step manner, starting with the basic scene setup and progressively adding the aircraft model, camera system, user controls, and movement.

Finally, the agent created the final documentation artifacts, including this project report.

## Successes

*   The agent successfully implemented all the features defined in the MVP.
*   The agent followed the `agent_manual.md` and created all the required documentation.
*   The final application is a functional flight simulator that meets the initial request.

## Challenges

*   **Testing:** Automated testing of a 3D rendered environment is complex. The agent decided to use a manual testing approach for this project, which is a reasonable trade-off for an MVP.
