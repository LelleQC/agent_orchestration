### Incident Report

**ID**: `INC-2025-001`

**Project**: `project_doodle_jump_backup`

**Symptom**: The game is unplayable at the start. The character is supposed to jump but immediately falls off the bottom of the screen, resulting in a "Game Over".

**RootCause**: The game logic was split between `game.js` and `script.js` using a Node.js `require/module.exports` pattern, which does not work in a browser environment, causing the game to not load correctly. Additionally, the player character's initial vertical velocity was zero, so gravity would immediately pull it down, with no initial jump to start the game.

**Resolution**:
1. Combined the logic from `game.js` and the rendering from `script.js` into a single `script.js` file, removing the non-functional `require` statement.
2. Added the line `game.player.dy = game.config.jumpForce;` after the `game.init();` call in `script.js` to give the player an initial upward velocity, starting the first jump.

**ProjectSpecificLearning**: For a browser-based JavaScript game, all script logic must be available in the global scope or bundled correctly. For a "Doodle Jump" style game, the player must have an initial upward momentum to begin the game if they don't start on a platform.

**GeneralizedPrinciple**: The initial state of an application must be tested to ensure it is playable or usable. For games with physics, this includes a "First Playable Action" test that validates core parameters (e.g., gravity, jump force) allow the user to perform the first required action successfully. All code intended for the browser must be written or transformed to be compliant with the browser's module system (or lack thereof).
