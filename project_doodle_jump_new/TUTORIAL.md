# How to Play: Doodle Jump Clone

Welcome! This is a quick guide on how to play this simple Doodle Jump game.

## 1. The Goal

The objective is to guide your character as high as you can by jumping from one platform to another. Don't fall!

## 2. Getting Started

*   Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
*   The game will start immediately.

## 3. Controls

The controls are very simple:

*   **Move Left:** Press the `Left Arrow` key on your keyboard.
*   **Move Right:** Press the `Right Arrow` key on your keyboard.

Your character will jump automatically. You only need to control the horizontal movement to land on the next platform.

## 4. How the Game Ends

If you miss a platform and your character falls below the bottom of the screen, the game is over. An alert will pop up, and the game will restart when you close the alert.
