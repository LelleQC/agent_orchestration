# Doodle Jump Clone

This project is a simple, browser-based clone of the classic game Doodle Jump, created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

*   Procedurally generated platforms.
*   Horizontal player control using the left and right arrow keys.
*   A camera that follows the player upwards.

## How to Play

3.  The goal is to climb as high as possible by jumping on the platforms.
