# Doodle Jump Game Tutorial

Welcome to Doodle Jump! This is a simple and fun endless jumper game where your goal is to guide your character as high as possible by jumping on platforms.

## Getting Started

1.  **Open the Game:** Locate the `index.html` file in the game's folder and open it with your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## How to Play

### Controlling Your Character

*   **Keyboard (Desktop/Laptop):**
    *   Use the **Left Arrow Key** to move your character to the left.
    *   Use the **Right Arrow Key** to move your character to the right.

*   **Touch (Mobile Devices):**
    *   **Swipe your finger left** on the game screen to move your character to the left.
    *   **Swipe your finger right** on the game screen to move your character to the right.

### Jumping

Your character will automatically jump whenever it lands on a platform. Your main task is to position your character correctly to land on the next platform.

### Collecting Items

Keep an eye out for **red square items** (springs)! If you land on one of these, your character will get an extra high jump boost, helping you reach new heights faster.

### Scoring

Your score increases as you ascend higher in the game. Try to beat your previous high score!

### Game Over

The game ends if your character falls off the bottom of the screen. Don't worry, you can always start a new game and try again!

## Tips for High Scores

*   **Plan Your Jumps:** Look ahead to see where the next platforms are. 
*   **Utilize Springs:** Always try to land on spring items for a significant boost.
*   **Stay Centered (Mostly):** While moving left and right is crucial, try not to get stuck too far on one side of the screen, as it might limit your options for the next jump.

Have fun playing Doodle Jump!
