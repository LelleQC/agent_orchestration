# Project: Chess Computer

This project is a simple, browser-based chess game where you can play against a powerful computer opponent powered by **Stockfish**.

This project was developed by an AI agent following a predefined workflow.

## Core Technologies

-   **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** The frontend is built with standard web technologies.
-   **`chess.js` library:** All chess logic, including move generation, validation, and game state detection (check, checkmate), is handled by the powerful `chess.js` library. This project focuses on the UI and integration, not on building a chess engine from scratch.

## How to Play

1.  **Open the game:**
    -   Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2.  **Start a game:**
    -   A new game starts automatically. You can press the "New Game" button at any time to restart.

## Files
