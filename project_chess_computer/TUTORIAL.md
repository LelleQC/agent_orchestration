# How to Play Chess Against the Computer

Welcome! This guide will explain how to play this chess game, even if you've never played before.

## 1. The Goal of Chess

The main goal is to trap your opponent's King so that it cannot escape. This is called **Checkmate**.

-   You play as the **White** pieces (the lighter colored ones).
-   The computer plays as the **Black** pieces.

## 2. How to Make a Move (Click & Click)

This game uses a simple "click-to-move" system:

1.  **First Click:** Click on one of your own pieces (a White piece).
    -   The square will turn green to show it's selected.
2.  **Second Click:** Click on an empty square or a square with an opponent's piece to move your selected piece there.

If the move is legal, your piece will move. If it is illegal, your selection will be cancelled, and you can try again.

To de-select a piece, simply click on it again or click on another one of your pieces.

## 3. Reading the Game Status

Above the board, you will see a status message. It will tell you:

-   Whose turn it is ("White's turn" or "Black's turn").
-   If a player is in check. 
-   When the game ends in Checkmate, a Draw, or a Stalemate.
