## 2. Understanding Your Screen

When you start, you will see three main things:

-   **The Paddle:** This is the blue rectangle at the bottom of the screen. This is what you control.
-   **The Ball:** The white ball that moves around the screen. Your goal is to keep it in play.
-   **The Bricks:** The grid of blue rectangles at the top. These are your targets.

## 3. How to Control the Paddle

Controlling the paddle is easy:

-   **Simply move your computer mouse left or right across the screen.**

Your paddle will follow your mouse's horizontal movement.

## 4. Gameplay: Step-by-Step

1.  **Start the Game:** Open the `index.html` file. The game begins immediately.
2.  **First Move:** The ball will start moving downwards towards your paddle. Move your paddle to position it underneath the ball.
3.  **Bounce the Ball:** When the ball hits your paddle, it will bounce back up towards the bricks.
4.  **Destroy Bricks:** Each time the ball hits a brick, that brick will disappear, and you get a point (the score is not visible yet, but you're winning!).
5.  **Don't Lose the Ball!** If the ball touches the bottom edge of the screen, the game is over.
6.  **You Win!** You win the game by clearing all the bricks from the screen.

## 5. A Pro Tip

Try to get the ball into the space *behind* the bricks. It will bounce around up there for a while, destroying many bricks at once!
