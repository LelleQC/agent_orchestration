# Project: Breakout Game

This is a classic Breakout-style game created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## How to Play

1.  **Open the game:**
    -   Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

2.  **Controls:**
    -   Move your mouse left and right to control the paddle at the bottom of the screen.

3.  **Objective:**
    -   Use the paddle to bounce the ball and destroy all the bricks at the top of the screen.
    -   If the ball falls past your paddle, the game is over.
    -   You win when all bricks are cleared.
