Okay, I have now read all the existing documentation.

  Here's the final analysis and the plan to complete the retroactive documentation process.

  Analysis of Existing Documentation

   * `README.md`, `TUTORIAL.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`: These documents describe a different project
     history than the one I uncovered in the sim_env notes. They focus on the challenge of importing a
     URDF file and completely omit the complex debugging story of the "snap-back" issue.
   * `project_report.md`, `meta_learnings.md`: These are also based on the URDF import problem. They
     contain valuable principles but miss the much richer learnings from the script conflict debugging.
   * `handover_context.md` (from `sim_env`): This is the real, detailed project report. It contains the
     true, complex story of debugging the script conflict.

  Conclusion

  The existing documentation in the docs folder is outdated or incomplete. It tells the story of "how
  to get the robot into the simulation," while the real, more complex and valuable work was "how to
  make the robot actually move."

  Final Plan to Synthesize and Complete

   1. Create a new `roadmap.md`: I will create a comprehensive roadmap.md in the project_household_robot
      directory. This roadmap will tell the full story, starting from the initial connection, through
      the URDF import, and detailing the entire "snap-back" debugging process as a series of [DONE]
      tasks. This will accurately reflect the project's history.

   2. Update `project_report.md` and `meta_learnings.md`: I will rewrite these two files.
       * The project_report.md will be based on the detailed history from handover_context.md.
       * The meta_learnings.md will be updated to include the much more sophisticated learnings from
         the script conflict debugging (e.g., "how to debug conflicting control scripts," "dynamic
         script modification as a workaround for write-protection").

   3. Update `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`: I will add a new section explaining the defaultMainScript.lua
      modification and the purpose of the modify_and_write_sandbox_script.py and

   4. Stamp Agent Version: I will create the .agent_version file.

  I will now begin with Step 1: Creating the `roadmap.md` file. I will generate the content and then        
  use the write_file tool.
