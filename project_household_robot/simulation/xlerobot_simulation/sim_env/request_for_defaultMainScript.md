I have discovered that the main script is loading a script named `defaultMainScript`. This is very likely the script that is causing the "snap-back" behavior.

I need your help to find this script. Please search for a file named `defaultMainScript.lua` in your CoppeliaSim installation directory.

Once you have found the file, please provide me with its full content.

Also, please provide me with the full path to your CoppeliaSim installation directory. This will help me in the future.
