I have found the sandbox script, and it is loading another script named `sandboxScript.lua`. This is the script that is causing the "snap-back" behavior.

I need your help again to find this script. Please search for a file named `sandboxScript.lua` in your CoppeliaSim installation directory (`C:\Program Files\CoppeliaRobotics\CoppeliaSimEdu`).

It is likely located in one of the following subdirectories:
- `C:\Program Files\CoppeliaRobotics\CoppeliaSimEdu\lua`
- `C:\Program Files\CoppeliaRobotics\CoppeliaSimEdu\scripts`
- `C:\Program Files\CoppeliaRobotics\CoppeliaSimEdu\system`

Once you have found the file, please provide me with its full content.
