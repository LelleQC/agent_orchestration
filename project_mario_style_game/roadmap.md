# Roadmap: Mario-Style Jump and Run Game

This document outlines the development plan for a simple jump and run game.

**Initial Complexity Assessment:** Medium

**Technology:** HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript (ES6)

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
A single, playable level where a character can run left and right, and jump on platforms. The camera will scroll to follow the player. There will be no enemies, scoring, or items in the MVP.

## Feature Checklist

-   `[DONE] Set up HTML Canvas and basic game loop.`
-   `[DONE] Implement player character with basic physics (gravity).`
-   `[DONE] Implement player movement (left/right).`
-   `[DONE] Implement player jumping.`
-   `[DONE] Create a static level structure with platforms.`
-   `[TODO] Implement collision detection between player and platforms.`
-   `[TODO] Implement basic camera scrolling to follow the player.`
-   `[TODO] (From Knowledge Base) Create a 'First Playable Action' test to verify the player can perform the first jump successfully.`
