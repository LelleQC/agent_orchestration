# Project: Snake Game

This is a simple, classic Snake game created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## How to Play

1.  **Open the game:**
    -   Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

2.  **Controls:**
    -   Use the **Arrow Keys** (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to control the direction of the snake.

3.  **Objective:**
    -   Guide the snake to eat the red food blocks.
    -   Each block eaten makes the snake grow longer and increases your score.
    -   The game ends if the snake runs into the walls or its own body.
